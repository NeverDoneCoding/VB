Hi Team,

Thank you for your time in today's meeting. Here are the key points we discussed:

We will start by focusing on the last three compliant policy rules.
Initial findings indicate that some servers are not in the required Organizational Units (OUs).
Action Plan:

Ashwin will send the list of non-compliant policies and non-compliant assets to Steve.
Steve will reorganize the Active Directory/OUs.
Shivam will rerun the scan after receiving confirmation from Steve.
Ashwin will recalculate compliance based on the new reports.
A weekly cadence will be set for Tuesday at 4 PM, with Paul Dy to be confirmed.
Please let me know if there are any questions or additional points.
